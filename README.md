# Temuulel_OBC

**Temuulel_OBC** is the onboard computer firmware project for the Temuulel satellite mission. This repository contains the core source code for the OBC, written in C, developed and tested using a VS-based development environment.

## üß† Overview

The onboard computer (OBC) is responsible for handling communication, telemetry, command processing, and mission-critical operations. This repository is focused on:

- Bare-metal embedded programming for STM32
- GPIO control, UART/SPI communication
- Power-on reset counter and LED behavior logic
- Button-based state switching
- Minimal dependencies (no dynamic memory / malloc)

## üìÅ Project Structure
- IDK just started

  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Build & Development

- Compiler: VS-based C compiler (without malloc support)
- Target: PIC18 microcontroller
- Toolchain: XC8 
- Debugging via UART & GPIO-based LED feedback

## ‚úÖ Features

- [x] Shutdown counter with persistent storage (EEPROM or similar)
- [x] LED behavior changes based on button input:
  - **Scroll mode**: LEDs shift one at a time
  - **Fill mode**: LEDs light up progressively
- [x] SPI and UART channel support for sensor and communication interfaces
- [ ] CRC integrity checks (future implementation)
- [ ] Telemetry packet handling

## üì¶ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ganjiguur16/Temuulel_OBC.git
   cd Temuulel_OBC
